This directory contains the CoNLL-U encoded machine translated ParlaMint-XX.ana corpus,
which was automatically coverted from its linguistically encoded TEI.ana version. The
corpus also contains NER annotation in the IOB format. Additionally, each
CoNLL-U file has an associated TSV file giving the metadata of its speeches.

Note that the CoNLL-U files do not contain all the information from the source
corpus, in particular, the transcriber comments are not included.
